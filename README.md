# Path Dinding with Djsktra's Algorithm

This demo is a project me and my partner developed under [BogaziciAI](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bogaziciai). In this project we wanted to visualize how path finding algorithms work. To that end, we initially created game.py, which is a playground that you can move in a hexagonal grid with QWE and ASD keys. The purpose is to reach the blue circle to the read circle.

Afterwards, we introduced barriers to the grid, and implemented dijkstra's algorithm which seeks the shortest path to the target in the following manner.
